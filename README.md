SystemVerilog Labs & Personal Projects

This repository contains my SystemVerilog lab work, HDL experiments, and personal hardware design projects.
All code is structured into labs (university coursework) and independent projects.

Folder Structure
1. labs/

Contains all university lab assignments:

Basic logic gates

Flip-flops

Counters

FSMs

Combinational and sequential circuits

Testbenches for all modules

Waveform screenshots (ModelSim/Questa)

2. personal_projects/

Contains my self-built HDL designs, such as:

32-bit ALU

Traffic light controller

FIFO, registers, muxes

Any experimental modules I build while learning

🛠 Tools Used

ModelSim / QuestaSim

Quartus Prime

Vivado (sometimes)

VS Code for writing SystemVerilog

Git & GitHub for version control

How to Run

Every lab or project contains:

*.sv source files

tb_*.sv testbenches

Open ModelSim → compile → simulate → view waveform.
